Q. What was the Atari Jaguar/Jaguar64?
 
A. The Atari Jaguar was the world's first 64-bit home console video game
   system.  Developed after three years of research, manufactured by IBM, the
   Jaguar was released in Fall 1993, and offered high-speed action,
   CD-quality sound, and polygon graphics processing beyond most other
   machines available at the time.

   Orignally released as the Jaguar, Atari had, at times, referred to the
   machine as the "Jaguar64" for marketing purposes.  For the sake of
   simplicity in this document, the term "Jaguar" will be used.

==============================================================================
 
Q. What was included when you bought a Jaguar?
 
A. The Jaguar was first sold for $250.  It came with the Jaguar itself, one
   controller, an AC adapter, a television RF switch box, and the CYBERMORPH
   video game.  Later on, the Jaguar was sold without a game, and as time
   progressed, the Jaguar was sold for $150, then $99.

==============================================================================
 
Q. What happened to Atari, anyway?
 
A. The trials and tribulations of Atari could fill a small book (and, in
   fact, once did).  To summarize VERY briefly, the history of Atari is as
   follows:
 
     1972   Atari Inc. founded by Nolan Bushnell from a $250 investment.
              Pong arcade game becomes a smash sensation.
     1976   Atari Inc. sold by Bushnell to Warner Inc. for $28 million.
     1980   Atari Inc. posts record sales.  $2 billion profits annually.
              Atari occupies 80 offices in Sunnyvale, CA.
     1983   Decline of video games and irresponsible spending by Atari Inc.
              results in record losses ($536 million, up to $2 million
              daily).
     1984   Warner divides Atari Inc.  Home division (Atari Corp.) is sold to
              Jack Tramiel.
     1985   Atari Corp. releases Atari ST home computer.
     1989   Atari Corp. releases Atari Lynx, the world's first color
              hand-held video game system (see the Atari Lynx FAQ).
     1993   Atari Games becomes Time-Warner Interactive.
     1993   Atari Corp. releases Atari Jaguar, the world's first 64-bit home
              video game system.
     1996   Time-Warner Interactive (Atari Games) sold to WMS.
     1996   Atari Corp. announces reverse merger with JTS Corporation.
     1996   Atari Corp. and JTS connsumate deal on July 31 1996.
     1998   Hasbro acquires the rights to Atari Corp.'s name and properties
     1999   Hasbro releases their rights to the Jaguar to the public; Atari
              is reborn as their new home video game label.

==============================================================================
 
Q. What was IBM's role in the Jaguar?
 
A. IBM had a $500 million contract with Atari Corp. to assemble, test,
   package, and distribute Jaguar units.  Manufacturing was done at IBM's
   Charlotte, NC facility, and the Jaguar was IBM's first attempt at
   producing a consumer-grade product for an outside vendor.  By mid-1994,
   Jaguar units were also manufactured by Comptronix in Colorado Springs.
 
   Jaguar circuit boards were manufactured and assembled by an IBM
   subcontractor; IBM then cased, tested, and packaged final Jaguar units,
   which were then sent to Atari.  IBM had no participation in the actual
   design of the Jaguar chipset.

==============================================================================

Q. Okay, who did design the Jaguar?

A. The primary designers of the Jaguar were Martin Brennan and John
   Mathieson.  They started their own company in 1986 called Flare 1, and
   designed an original multiprocessor game console.  After the system was
   finished, Flare wanted to "evolve" the system, but needed funding for the
   job.  Atari was contacted, believed in the idea, and agreed to
   participate.  Atari, Brennan, and Mathieson started a new company called
   Flare 2 to develop the system. As Jaguar development moved along, it
   became apparent that the machine would leapfrog the then-new systems from
   Nintendo and Sega (the Super Nintendo and Sega Genesis, respectively), so
   they decided to bring the machine to light.  The entire process took three
   years, from initial design to production-ready models.

   The proprietary Jaguar chipsets were manufactured by Toshiba and Motorola.
   According to Chris Gibbs, Attention To Detail was asked to write
   technology demos for the Jaguar chipset.  The company opted to develop a
   game instead, resulting in the first Jaguar title, CYBERMORPH.

   The Flare design was was reportedly based on a project called "Loki,"
   developed by Sinclair Research.  Information about the Loki project can
   be found at http://www.nvg.ntnu.no/sinclair/planet/lokifram.htm

==============================================================================

Q. What are the specifications of the Jaguar?

A. Physical dimensions:

       Size: 9.5" x 10" x 2.5"
   Controls: Power on/off
    Display: Programmable screen resolution.  Horizontal resolution is
               dependent on the amount of scanline buffer space given to the
               "Tom" graphics processor.  Maximum vertical resolution varies
               according to the refresh rate (NTSC or PAL).  Reportedly, a
               stock Jaguar (without additional memory) running NTSC can
               display up to 576 rows of pixels.
             24-bit "True Color" display with 16,777,216 colors
               simultaneously (additional 8 bits of supplimental graphics
               data support possible)
             Multiple-resolution, multiple-color depth objects (monochrome,
               2-bit, 4-bit, 8-bit, 16-bit, 24-bit) can be used
               simultaneously
      Ports: Cartridge slot/expansion port (32 bits)
             RF video output
             Video edge connector (video/audio output)
               (supports NTSC and PAL; provides S-Video, Composite, RGB
               outputs, accessible by optional add-on connector)
             Two controller ports
             Digital Signal Processor port (includes high-speed synchronous
               serial input/output)
Controllers: Eight-directional joypad
             Size 6.25" x 5" x 1.6", cord 7 feet
             Three fire buttons (A, B, C)
             Pause and Option buttons
             12-key keypad (accepts game-specific overlays)

  The Jaguar has five processors which are contained in three chips.  Two of
  the chips are proprietary designs, nicknamed "Tom" and "Jerry".  The third
  chip is a standard Motorola 68000, and used as a coprocessor.  Tom and
  Jerry are built using an 0.5 micron silicon process.  With proper
  programming, all five processors can run in parallel.

    - Joystick control

  - Motorola 68000 (processor #5)
    - Runs at 13.295MHz

   Communication is performed with a high speed 64-bit data bus, rated at
   106.364 megabytes/second.  The 68000 is only able to access 16 bits of
   this bus at a time.

   The Jaguar contains two megabytes (16 megabits) of fast page-mode DRAM,
   in four chips with 512 K each.  Game cartridges can support up to six
   megabytes (48 megabits) of information, and can contain an EEPROM
   (electrically erasable/programmable read-only memory) chip to save game
   information and settings.  Up to 100,000 writes can be performed with the
   EEPROM; after that, future writes may not be saved (performance varies
   widely, but 100,000 is a guaranteed minimum).  Depending on use, this
   limit should take from 10 to 50 years to reach.

   The Jaguar uses 24-bit addressing, and is reportedly capable of accessing
   data as follows:

           Six megabytes cartridge ROM
           Eight megabytes DRAM
           Two megabytes miscellaneous/expansion

   All of the processors can access the main DRAM memory area directly.  The
   Digital Signal Processor and the Graphics Processor can execute code out
   of either their internal caches, or out of main memory.  The only
   limitations are that

   (1) "jump" instructions in main memory have certain restrictions; the JMP
         (unconditional jump) command is longword-aligned, while the JR
         (jump-indexed-by-register) command must be either word- or longword-
         aligned.  And
   (2) running out of the cache is much faster (up to four times faster) and
         efficient.

   Some believe that the inability to jump/branch in main memory makes the
   main memory feature useless.

   Swapping data between the caches and the main memory is a quick, low
   overhead operation, and therefore the main memory is often used as "swap
   space" for cache code.  The RISC compiler included in the latest Jaguar
   developer's kit produced code that transparently swaps code through the
   cache.  This effectively allowed developers write RISC code without
   concern for the cache size limits.

   Compressed cartridge data can be uncompressed in real-time, and ratios of
   up to 14:1 have been cited.  In theory, a Jaguar cartridge can store up to
   84 megabytes (672 megabits) of data, though actual results will vary
   widely (most often, images are compressed, while sound and code are not).
   Compression is performed with BPEG, an enhanced JPEG image decompression
   mechanism.  BPEG supercedes the former JagPEG algorithm, working up to 10
   times faster and with more flexibility.

   Other Jaguar features:
   - Support for ComLynx I/O for communications with the Atari Lynx hand-held
       game system and networked multiconsole games (on DSP port, accessible
       by optional add-on connector).  Networking of up to 32 Jaguar units
       available.
   - The two controller ports can be expanded to support "dozens" of
     controllers
     - Digital and analog interfaces
     - Keyboards, mice, and light guns are possible
   - Expansion port allows connection to cable TV and other networks
   - Digital Signal Processor port allows connection to modems and digital
     audio peripherals (such as DAT players)
   - One megabyte per second serial interface
   - 9600 baud, RS-232 serial port (accessible with optional interface)
   - General-purpose I/O bits via the cartridge port
   - Can accomodate future expansions of different processor types, I/O
       types, video types, and memory types and/or quantities.

==============================================================================
 
Q. Was the Jaguar really a 64-bit system?
 
A. The question is hard to resolve, largely because the definition of what
   constitutes an "N-bit" system has not been set.  Of the five processors in
   the Jaguar, only the object processor and the blitter are "true" 64-bit
   components.  Because the blitter and the object processor are in the Tom
   chip, by extension Tom is a 64-bit chip.  Furthermore, the Jaguar also
   used a 64-bit memory architecture, according to Jez San of Argonaut
   Software.

   Some say the Jaguar should be considered a 32-bit system, as that is the
   maximum register size in the programmable processors (the 68000, the
   graphics processor, and the DMA sound processor).  Others say the Jaguar
   can be considered a 64-bit system, because 64-bit components are used, and
   the GPU can access 64 bits of data if required.  Again, the lack of an
   agreed-upon definition serves to complicate the issue.

   According to Jaguar designer John Mathieson, "Jaguar has a 64-bit memory
   interface to get a high bandwidth out of cheap DRAM. ... Where the system
   needs to be 64 bit then it is 64 bit, so the Object Processor, which takes
   data from DRAM and builds the display is 64 bit; and the blitter, which
   does all the 3D rendering, screen clearing, and pixel shuffling, is 64
   bit.  Where the system does not need to be 64 bit, it isn't.  There is no
   point in a 64 bit address space in a games console!  3D calculations and
   audio processing do not generally use 64-bit numbers, so there would be no
   advantage to 64 bit processors for this.

   "Jaguar has the data shifting power of a 64 bit system, which is what
   matters for games, so can reasonably be considered a 64 bit system.  But
   that doesn't mean it has to be 64 bits throughout."

   For the record, the opinion of most third party developers and observers
   is that the Jaguar is indeed a 64-bit system.  The emphasis is on the word
   "system"; while not every component is 64 bits, the Jaguar architecture,
   as a COMPLETE SYSTEM, is.

==============================================================================
 
Q. The Jaguar used a 68000.  Isn't that the CPU?
 
A. Again, quoting from Jaguar designer John Mathieson, "It may be the CPU in
   the sense that it's the centre of operation, and boot-straps the machine,
   and starts everything else going; however, it is not the centre of
   Jaguar's power. ... The 68000 is like a manager who does no real work, but
   tells everybody else what to do."

   And...

   "Atari were keen to use a 68K family device, and we looked closely at
   various members.  We did actually build a couple of 68030 versions of the
   early beta developers systems, and for a while were going to use a 68020.
   However, this turned out too expensive.  We also considered the
   possibility of no [Motorola 680x0 chip] at all.  I always felt it was
   important to have some normal processor, to give developers a warm feeling
   when they start.  The 68K is inexpensive and does that job well.  I
   maintain that it's only there to read the joysticks."

==============================================================================
 
Q. How could a graphics processor be the CPU?
 
A. The 64-bit custom graphics chip was a good general purpose RISC unit, but
   it had been optimized for graphics work.  Developers were free to specify
   which processor(s) to use in a program, as desired.

==============================================================================
 
Q. What kind of special effects could the Jaguar do?
 
A. The Jaguar was capable of doing the following visual effects:
 
   - High-speed scrolling (Object Processor).
   - Texture mapping on two- and three-dimensional objects (GPU and Blitter).
   - Morphing one object into another object (GPU).
   - Scaling, rotation, distortion, and skewing of sprites and images
       (Object Processor).
   - Lighting and shading from single and multiple light sources (GPU and
       Blitter).
   - Transparency (Object Processor).
   - "Rendering" up to 850 million one-bit pixels/second (35 million 24-bit
       pixels/second, 26 million 32-bit pixels/second), or 50 million Goroud
       shaded pixels/second.  "Rendering" is believed to mean transferring a
       pixel from a frame buffer to the screen.
   - Sprites of "unlimited" size and quantity.  Realistically, sprites can be
       over 1,000 pixels wide/tall, and the number of sprites allowed is
       limited by processor cycles instead of a fixed value in hardware
       (Object processor).
   - Programmable screen resolutions, from 160 to 800 pixels per line.  The
       resolution can be increased even further with additional hardware up
       to a reported 1350 pixels per line.

   One of the Jaguar modes is called "CRY mode", which supports lighting and
   effects in 3D graphics.  Red, green, and blue color elements are ranged
   from 0 to 255, and the lighting level for any pixel can be changed by
   setting one byte linearly.  E.g., the relative proportions of red, blue,
   and green are indicated with one byte, while a second byte selects an
   overall intensity of 0 to 255.  CRY allows much smoother shading of single
   colors, but doesn't allow blending between colors as smoothly.

   Actual graphics performance is hard to measure, as there are no industry-
   standard benchmarks.  Rebellion Software has claimed that the Jaguar can
   render "10,000 Gourard shaded, large, 65536 color, any shape polygons per
   second," while still performing other tasks.  Presumably this level can
   be increased further with optimized programming; indeed, some unofficial
   calculations speculate that FIGHT FOR LIFE may generate between 20,000 to
   40,000 texture-mapped polygons per second.

   A key to understanding the Jaguar's performance is to realize that most
   effects are accomplished by programming one of the processors to do the
   job.  To perform texture-mapping, for instance, required a developer to
   write a texture-mapping routine for the GPU and/or blitter, then call it
   as needed.  The general-purpose nature of the Jaguar architecture gave
   developers a lot of flexibility; unfortunately, the drawback was that
   software routines for such effects are invariably slower and less
   efficient than dedicated hardware chips and components.

==============================================================================
 
Q. How come the Jaguar claims to have "32-bit" graphics, when only 24 bits
   are needed to render 16 million colors?
 
A. The additional 8-bits was for programmers to implement whatever visual
   effects might be desired.  Examples cited include Z-buffering (for polygon
   graphics) and an alpha channel (for transparency).

==============================================================================
 
Q. Who were the third-party publishers/developers for the Jaguar?
 
A. The following companies have, at one time or another, been announced as
   official developers, licensees, or publishers for the Jaguar.  Note that
   an official announcement was not an obligation for a company to produce
   Jaguar-related products; many times, it merely meant that the company made
   a commitment to "consider" producing product(s) for Atari.

Q. What were the unreleased Jaguar games?
 
A: The following games were announced at one time or another as being planned
   for the Jaguar.  With the dissolution of Atari, the chances are very slim
   that any of these games will ever be produced or released.  However, a few
   enterprising companies and individuals have considered plans to either
   finish their Jaguar titles for release, to sell finished-but-unreleased
   games, or to produce new games on their own.

Q. Where can I get a review and/or comments about <insert game name here>?
 
A: Robert A. Jung (rjung@netcom.com) has reviews of some Jaguar games and
   peripherals.  They are available on the world-wide web at his web site,
   at http://www.digiserve.com/eescape/atari/Atari.shtml

==============================================================================
 
Q. Where can I find secrets, tips, and hints for <insert game name here>?
 
A. A comprehensive list of Jaguar cheats and codes is available from "The
   Mage," at http://users.aol.com/TheMage1/jaguar/jagcodes.txt or
   http://members.aol.com/TheMage1/jaguar/jagcodes.txt

   Clay Halliwell maintains the Atari Jaguar Cheats and Codes FAQ, which he
   updates regularly.  It can be found on the world-wide web at
   http://www.atarihq.com/jaglynx/jag/jagcheat.txt

==============================================================================
 
Q. Is there a Jaguar emulator available?
 
A. No Jaguar emulators currently exist, and it is the opinion of some Jaguar
   developers that the system architecture is too complex to be emulated by a
   current desktop computer using a Pentium or PowerPC processor.  On the
   other hand, "RealityMan" (developer of the UltraHLE Nintendo64 emulator
   for Windows 95) is reported to be working on a Jaguar emulator.  For news
   updates, visit http://www.emuunlim.com/
 
==============================================================================
 
Q. Some of my Jaguar games don't have overlays for the keypads.  Where can I
   get them?
 
A. Not all Jaguar games used overlays for the keypad; some titles didn't use
   the keypad at all, while others used the keypad, but the developers did
   not feel that an overlay was needed.  Making your own keypads is certainly
   possible; simply use an existing keypad for a template, draw whatever
   designs you like, then cut and to fit.
 
   Tony Price has made a number of overlays for Jaguar games that didn't
   include them, as well as dust covers for the keypads.  He can be reached
   by mail at mfmurdock@earthlink.net, or on the world-wide web at
   http://home.earthlink.net/~mfmurdock/jaguar/jaguar.htm

==============================================================================

Q. What's the information on the CD-ROM drive?

A. A double-speed CD-ROM drive was available.  The CD drive has an access
   time of 210 milliseconds, and has a sustained data transfer rate of 352.8K
   per second.  The CD-ROM drive features a modified data bus interface for
   access to the Tom and Jerry chips almost directly, allowing for a higher
   throughput rate on sound and graphics.  Storage on a disc is approximately
   790 megabytes (6,320 megabits).  The CD-ROM drive plugs into the Jaguar's
   cartridge slot.  A pass-through cartridge slot allows cartridges to be
   used with the CD-ROM attached.  Separate memory cartridges allow Jaguar CD
   games to be saved for later play.

   The Jaguar CD format is a non-standard format that is not compatable with
   the ISO-9660 standard.  It uses audio-format sectors for data, which
   allows for 2352 bytes of useable space in each sector.  Unfortunately,
   this leaves no provision for error correction or file system management
   (though errors are detected by the CD drive hardware).  Each disc is
   copy-protected with encrypted data that is specially formatted to look
   like an error.  Attempts to copy a Jaguar CD will fail because it cannot
   read the encrypted data, which means the copy will not work.

   The Jaguar CD allows delivery of full-screen, full-motion video.  The
   CinePak video decompression system has been licensed from SuperMac
   Technologies.  It is a 7K routine in the GPU and can be included in any
   CD-ROM software that needs it, allowing full-screen video at 24 frames per
   second.  Movie quality pictures can then be overlaid on the screen with
   computer generated graphics if the game demands it.  Time-Warner has
   licensed a library of film clips from its movies to Atari.

   The Jaguar CD has "Virtual Light Machine" built in.  This program plays
   audio CDs and generate accompanying color and visual effects that react to
   the music and sounds.  The user can control and select effects with the
   Jaguar controller.  Regular audio CD playback features (volume control,
   track programming, etc.) are also available.

   The Jaguar CD can also display CD+Graphics discs.  Supplimental cartridges
   for Kodak PhotoCD and MPEG-1 (Motion Picture Experts Group) compression
   were considered.  The MPEG cartridge would reportedly include extra RAM
   for buffering and support the whitebook video format.

   The drive was being manufactured by Philips in the United States.  Its
   dimensions are 6.5" x 10.5" x 3.5", and it weighs 1 pound, 10 ounces.  The
   price was $150, and includes the TEMPEST 2000 soundtrack audio disc, a
   sampler for the CD game MYST, and two CD-ROM games: VID GRID and BLUE
   LIGHTNING.

==============================================================================

Q. What's the information on the virtual reality headset?

A. Atari Corp. and the Virtuality Group had signed a contract whereupon
   Virtuality would develop virtual reality hwardware and software for the
   Jaguar.  In return, Virtuality would get the rights to port Jaguar VR
   games to their Virtuality arcade consoles.

   Though announced, the Jaguar VR was never produced.  Unofficial reports
   conflict on whether the unit was cancelled, suspended, and/or reworked.
   Reasons given for the inaction ranged from Atari's needs to reassess their
   investments and focus on core business, to the high suggested retail price
   of the Jaguar VR headset, to Virtuality's problems in trying to create
   a mass-market headset that could track head movement fast enough to avoid
   motion sickness after a few minutes of play.

   As originally reported, the Jaguar VR package consisted of two components:

   (1) A lightweight headset (weighs less than one pound).  It can be
       adjusted for fit and works with or without glasses.  Game graphics are
       provided by a single 7", TFT active-matrix color LCD screen, with a
       resolution of 260 by 400 pixels and up to 65,000 colors.  Dual temple
       speakers provide sound, and a built-in microphone allows player
       communication in future networked games.  A custom optical system
       projects a binocular image to both eyes; it is aligned at infinity, so
       focus adjustment is not needed.  Two degrees of freedom (left/right
       and up/down) are available.  Field of view is 52 degrees horizontal by
       40 degrees vertical.

   (2) A tabletop-mounted tracking station.  The station senses the position
       of the controller and the headset with "V-Trak" infra-red tracking.
       The tracking speed is 250 Hz, with a lag time of 4 milliseconds, four
       times faster than Virtuality's arcade hardware.  The tracker has a
       range of approximately 100 degrees; multiple trackers can be daisy-
       chained together to provide a complete 360-degree tracking range, but
       most Jaguar VR games will not require a full 360 degrees.

   The Jaguar VR equipment was designed to be played while sitting down, so
   as to avoid injuries.  if a player moves out of the tracking station's
   range, a safety cutoff would have been triggered to suspend the game.

   Jaguar VR games would have been written for use with the regular
   controller, as well as a two-button "virtual gun" hand-held joystick.  The
   licensing agreement between Atari and Virtuality permitted authorized
   Jaguar third-party software developers to write their own VR titles.

   One product did come out of the Atari/Virtuality agrement.  MISSILE
   COMMAND 3D for the Jaguar provided virtual-reality type play, without the
   need for special equipment or controllers.  The game was later transported
   to Virtuality's arcade systems.

==============================================================================
 
Q. What's the "Panther"?
 
A. Quick history lesson: Sometime in the late 1980s, Atari Corp. was doing
   research and development on "next generation" video game consoles.  There
   were two systems, a 32-bit machine called the Panther, and a 64-bit
   machine called the Jaguar.  It is reported that work on the Jaguar was
   progressing better/faster than expected, so Atari abandoned the Panther to
   focus their energies on the Jaguar instead.  Supposedly, if both machines
   were fully developed, the Jaguar would have followed the Panther only two
   years later.

   Reports of development work on the Panther have been whispered since 1988;
   some people have erroneously mistaken those rumors to be about the Jaguar.

   The Panther reportedly was considered a "32-bit" machine by Atari, though
   for reasons unknown.  It featured three chips, consisting of a Motorola
   68000 running at 16Mhz, an object processor called the Panther, and an
   Ensoniq sound processor called Otis, featuring 32 sound channels.  The
   Panther could supposedly display 8,192 colors from a palette of 262,144
   colors, and could display 65,535 sprites of any size simultaneously.

   According to Jeff Minter, the Panther's sprite hardware was very similar
   to the object processor in the Jaguar, to the point where both had the
   same limitations.  Putting too many sprites on a single scan-line, for
   instance, would require too much time to draw the line and caused a
   "tearing" effect in the affected row.

   Stefan Walgenbach is the proud owner of a working Panther prototype.  He
   has a web page at http://www.HomeComputer.de/ devoted to all sorts of
   information on the Panther.

==============================================================================
 
Q. What's the "Jaguar II"?
 
A. There's been a little confusion with this topic, since at least two
   separate machines have been called a "Jaguar II."  The first was to have
   been an integrated Jaguar/Jaguar CD-ROM unit.  That project has since been
   cancelled, making the point moot.

   The other Jaguar II was Atari's next video-game console.  Though rumors
   were passed, a final design was apparently never produced for even the
   prototype stage.  The following rumors were strongly suggested, however:
 
   * Main chipset (codename "Midsummer") developed by Motorola.
   * Fully backwards compatable with the existing Jaguar.  Would have been
       able to play all Jaguar games and use all Jaguar peripherals.
   * Processing speed "two to four times faster than the Sony PlayStation."
   * Full C/C++ development package available.

==============================================================================
 
Q. What's the information on the CoJag and CoJag games?
 
A. To briefly recap, after the Jaguar was released, Time-Warner Interactive
   (now a subsidiary of WMS/Midway known as Atari Games) licensed the Jaguar
   architecture for use in arcade games.  These systems were called "CoJag"
   games, and consisted of a Jaguar chipset with additional memory, extra
   storage, and other architectural changes.
 
   Two CoJag games have been released:
 
   * Area 51: A light-gun shooting game for two players.  The Jaguar's 68000
     was replaced with a 68020 or SGI R3K, and ran at 25 MHz.  It was also
     equipped with a four megabytes of RAM and a one gigabyte hard drive.
 
   * Maximum Force: Another light-gun shooting game.  The 68000 was replaced
     with an SGI R3K, and came with six megabytes of RAM and a two gigabyte
     hard drive.
 
   While it was rumored that the TWI games "Primal Rage" and "T-Mek" were
   also CoJag games, this is false; developer Al Vernon has confirmed that
   those titles did not use any aspect of the Jaguar design or chipset.
 
   Finally, funkster@midwinter.com reports that he playtested a third CoJag
   game, "Freeze," that was never released.  Here's a slightly-edited version
   of his report:
 
     "I saw Freeze a couple weeks ago at a local arcade pinball/video
     game expo.  The game made it to field test but didn't do well, so
     Atari Games axed it early this year.
 
     "Freeze was a puzzle game, most closely related to Bust-A-Move or
     Super Puzzle Fighter II Turbo.  You controlled a character at the
     bottom of a rectangular grid, five wide and eight deep.  You had
     the following controls: move left, move right, throw, and special.
     You start with a fish in your hands; when you press 'throw,' you
     threw it into the grid, where it goes up until it hits something.
     Once your hands are empty, a fish launcher gives you another.
 
     "The goal is to get groupings of three or more similarly-colored
     fish to touch each other, at which point they disappear.  Holes
     are filled in by reverse gravity -- the fish fall up.  The game is
     over when your grid is full of fish or ice.
 
     "Here's where it gets original: when you get a group of fish to
     disappear, you "freeze" a couple of fish on your opponent's field,
     starting at the top and working down.  A frozen fish doesn't work
     for groupings; fish are unfrozen by making a group nearby.  Empty
     slots get frozen too (the ice is empty).
 
     "The 'special' button is for a special attack.  When you start the
     game, you pick a character, which also decides which special attack
     you get.  I didn't play that much of the game, so I don't know how
     the special works or when you get it.  You could play one or two
     players simultaneously.  One player meant playing against computer
     opponents, along with a bizarre story -- I usually played the
     monkey character, who was searching for an alarm clock so he
     wouldn't oversleep, and he asked his opponents for a clock.
 
     "The game was pretty fun, and the graphics were nice.  It had a
     look like Trog -- simple 3D, bright saturated colors.  It's a shame
     it didn't fare better in field test."

Q. Was there a difference in Jaguar games/units sold in different countries?
   Do I need to keep track of PAL and NTSC versions of a game?

A. There is no difference in the Jaguar game software.  A properly-written
   Jaguar game detects PAL or NTSC at startup and changes the playfield size
   and game speeds accordingly.  A properly-written Jaguar game will run at
   the same speed on either machine.  There are no regional or national
   market lock-outs as there are for other game consoles.

   The Jaguar consoles themselves were configured differently, according to
   the country they were sold in.  The primary differences were in the video
   output format (NTSC or PAL) and the power adapters (110 volt or 220 volt).
   Due to the Jaguar's use of an external adapter, a step-down transformer is
   not needed.  A local PSU can be used so long as it matches these
   specifications:
 
         1. 9 volt direct current (DC)
         2. 1.2 amps
         3. Center pin negative
 
   The PSUs from old Sinclair computers and Sega Game Gears can be used with
   the Jaguar without problems.
 
   To use an American (NTSC) Jaguar in Europe, you will need a new power
   adapter and a SCART lead to supply the Jaguar's RGB signals to the TV.
   Some European TV sets might have also required changing the Jaguar display
   from a 60Hz frame rate to 50Hz.
 
   The 50Hz/60Hz frame rate is set by soldering pads on the bottom of the
   Jaguar PCB.  On an NTSC Jaguar, they're located on the bottom of the PCB
   near the controller ports.  The set labelled "R140" determines between
   50Hz and 60Hz.  Connect the two points for 50Hz, or leave them
   disconnected for 60Hz, as follows:

             60Hz          50Hz
              o-o   R135    o-o
              o o   R136    o o   (Information courtesy of Martin Zimmer,
              o o   R137    o o    marz@haari.mayn.sub.de)
              o o   R140    o-o

   PAL Jaguars sold in Europe have the R140 pads connected with a zero ohm
   SMD resistor, which can be removed with a soldering iron.  It is possible
   to wire a switch to the points, allowing the Jaguar to be toggled between
   50Hz/60Hz.  This is mainly useful for PAL Jaguars to play games at the
   original speed and screen resolution of the NTSC version.

   Russ Juckes (russ_j@raiden.demon.co.uk) gives these instructions for
   finding the pads on a European/PAL Jaguar:

   "Hold the Jaguar PCB with the Joystick ports to the bottom.  On the
   underside of the board, near the joystick ports, and to the left of centre
   there are four links, the top and the bottom one bridged.  (Both with zero
   ohm resistors).  Above them there is another link, with a brown resistor.

   "The bottom link is the one that needs to be broken.  I used a penknife to
   scratch away the solder, and then a needle-nosed pair of pliers to break
   the resistor.

   "The links are *not* labelled in any way.  As another guide to make sure
   you are about to snip the correct link, they are placed directly
   underneath a chip (which is obviously on the top of the PCB!) so if you
   use a soldering iron, be careful!"

Q. Hey!  My Jaguar makes a quiet hissing sound!  What's going on?  Is it
   dangerous?
 
A. Early Atari Jaguars had a rumored problem with the console hissing softly.
   Atari had cited several reasons for the hissing noise.  Some have said
   that the sound is from the RF generator.  The RF shield has holes in it
   (ostensibly to help air flow and keep the unit cool), and it is believed
   that the holes produce the noise.

   Others said the sounds are produced by coil L29 which is responsible for
   the proper voltage regulation to +10.0V, together with U38.  The coil's
   copper wire vibrates when the current through it changes abruptly, making
   the hiss.
 
   There are two solutions: 1) Use plastic spray or silicone rubber glue to
   fix the coil's wire. 2) Replace the original Jaguar power-supply with a
   variable power-source, using 7.5V DC instead of 9V DC (it is not certain
   whether the Jaguar CD will require 9V DC, which would make this "fix"
   unworkable with the CD drive).

   In any case, the "hissing" noise was not dangerous, but merely annoying.
   It was usually audible only if you put your ear next to the unit and
   listen closely, and is not interference in the audio output.  It is
   roughly analogous to the buzz made by electric clocks.

   Most later Jaguars did not have this problem, though a few rare cases have
   been noted.

==============================================================================

Q. My Jaguar comes up with a red screen instead of a game!  Is it broken?

A. Most often, the "red screen" problem appears after the Jaguar logo has
   disappeared off the TV screen, and is caused by one of the following:

   1. Poor contact between the Jaguar and the cartridge (most likely).  Make
   sure that the cartridge is firmly seated in the cartridge slot, and that
   contacts are not dirty/dusty.

   2. Bent pins in the cartridge slot (rare).  This may be caused by rough
   edges on some cartridges.  The pins should be carefully straightened.

   3. Defective cartridge (rare).  If the red screen only appears with one
   cartridge but not others, the game may be defective.  Exchange it for
   another.

   If the Jaguar logo appears without problems, then the Jaguar is probably
   working fine, and it's only the data transfer between the unit and the
   cartridge that's causing the problem.

==============================================================================
 
Q. I've heard stories about the Jaguar version of DOOM having network errors
   when playing with two Jaguars linked together.  Are they real?  If so,
   what causes the problem, and can I avoid it?
 
A. There is some truth to the reports -- when linking two Jaguars together
   for multiplayer DOOM games, network errors sometimes appear which
   interfere with the gameplay.  At worst, the game resets to the start of
   the current level, which can be annoying if you're in the middle of a
   heated Deathmatch firefight.
 
   The problem stems from several causes.  The networking code in DOOM was
   not thoroughly tested before release, because the game was finished before
   Atari settled on the final specifications for the JagLink cable (the cable
   came out almost a year after DOOM did).  As a result, this causes some
   problems due to integration differences.  On the other hand, some of the
   folks playing networked DOOM are using their own home-made link cables,
   which might not have enough shielding, which also causes errors.  There
   are reports that earlier Jaguar models are more susceptible to errors as
   well, but the evidence is inconclusive.
 
   Recommendations?  Set up your Jaguars in an area relatively clean of
   electromagnetic interference, make sure you are using a well-shielded
   cable, and cross your fingers.  And remember that, even with an
   occassional networking error, DOOM is still lots of fun with a friend
   (or foe).

Q. What's this about a rotary controller?  What games use it?  How do I make
   one for myself?

A. TEMPEST 2000 has hidden in it an option for a rotary controller (at the
   "Game Options" menu, press Pause on both controllers to activate the
   "Controller Type").  No plans for an official Atari rotary controller were
   announced, but many TEMPEST fans have been trying to build such a
   controller, to give the game a feel that's close to its arcade original.

   Andy Light has written instructions for taking a Jaguar joypad and an
   Atari 2600 Driving Controller and building a rotary controller with the
   parts.  His instructions are condensed below.  READ THE INSTRUCTIONS
   THOROUGHLY BEFORE ASSEMBLY -- there are some areas that are left to the
   whim of the builder, and advance planning is highly recommended.

                                    * * *

   ANDY LIGHT'S JAGUAR ROTARY CONTROLLER INSTRUCTIONS
   Parts needed: Atari Jaguar controller
                 Atari 2600 Driving Controller (NOT the paddles)
                 13 wires, preferably of separate colors
                 Buttons
                 A board or box or shell to mount everything on/in
 
   1. Open the driving controller by removing the two underside screws.
   Inside is a top-like device or a grey box with three wires coming out of
   it.  This is the encoder.  Pull the driving controller's knob off the
   encoder's shaft, then remove the encoder by unscrewing the nut that holds
   it in place.  Disconnect the wires from the encoder.

   2. Open the Jaguar controller.  There are four screws on the bottom
   holding it together, behind the round rubber pads.  Inside the controller
   are two circuit boards connected by a ribbon of wires.  The bottom board
   is for the numeric keypad and is held by two screws.  Remove the screws
   and take out the keypad.

   3. Disconnect the wire ribbon from the keypad by melting the solder.
   CAREFUL!  This is delicate work -- get help if you need it.  Solder the
   thirteen wires where the ribbon connection was; do not confuse them.

   4. From the left side of the board (the side that says "P2"), I've
   numbered the wires as follows:
      1) Common         5) Button A       9) Button C      13) Down
      2) Right          6) Button B      10) Pause
      3) Option         7) Button B      11) Up
      4) Option         8) Button C      12) Left
 
   5. On the encoder, connect wire #1 to the center terminal, #2 to the right
   terminal, and #12 to the left terminal.  The rotary part of the controller
   is now finished.

   6. How to connect the other controls is up to you.  I'm using arcade
   buttons, a thumbpad, and a switch (to toggle joypad or rotary control)
   mounted in an Atari 5200 trak-ball controller case.  You can mount a
   joystick, extra buttons, or other features for your own controller.
   Buttons and empty control boxes are available at stores such as Radio
   Shack.

   Wiring for the other signals are as follows:
         Up       - wires #1 and #11       Button A - wires #1 and #5
         Down     - wires #1 and #13       Button B - wires #6 and #7
         Pause    - wires #1 and #10       Button C - wires #8 and #9
         Option   - wires #3 and #4
   Because wire #1 has multiple uses, you will either need to string it or
   split it for each destination.

   7. Reassemble and mount everything according to your design.  For better
   spin, you can glue lead fishing sinkers to the inside of the knob, and
   lubricate the shaft of the encoder with light oil or silicone lubricant.

   That's it!  Please forgive me for any mistakes in my grammer, terminology,
   spelling, etc.  If you encounter any problems, feel free to e-mail me at
   ALIGHT55@AOL.COM.  Good luck!

Q. I want something better than RF output from my Jaguar.  What do I do?
 
A. Atari had an S-Video cable and a Composite video cable available for use
   with the Jaguar.  See the "Peripherals" section for details.

   If you are willing to build your own, the schematics for the expansion
   port are as follows:

Q. How did the ComLynx port on the Jaguar work?  Could I connect my Lynx to
   it?

A. The Jaguar does not have a ComLynx port per se, but has a ComLynx signal
   on the system bus.  An expansion port add-on would have made the port
   available, and developers had announced plans for such accessories.  It is
   possible to daisy-chain multiple Jaguars for multiplayer games into a
   "Jaguar network".  In theory, it would have also been possible to connect
   Jaguars and Lynxes, though no plans for cross-system software were ever
   finalized.

   There was also talk that the Jaguar's ComLynx signal could allow Lynxes to
   be used as peripherals: software could have been developed to allow Lynxes
   to be part of a Jaguar game as "smart" controllers.  Again, no actual
   plans were ever announced.

   For enterprising engineers who wish to build a ComLynx cable for two
   Jaguars, the following schematics from jonin@netcom.com are available.

                Key signals: 2 - Transmit, 3 - Receive, 6 - Ground

   Assembly Notes:
     As shown, the only 3 wires needed for the cable are 2, 3 and 6 (Tx, Rx,
     and Ground).  All of these wires are on the bottom connector, so that
     is a good indicater of which way the cable plugs in the Jaguar.
     Shielded and RF-Choked cables work best.  Due to the nature of this
     connector, it will be hard to shield this cable completely.

     If you cannot find a 12-contact IDE Card Edge Connector, a 10-contact
     version can be used.  A quick one can be built with no soldering using
     JDR MicroDevices (Part# IDE10).  This is made for ribbon cable, but you
     can use regular shielded cables with a little work.  As long as lines 2,
     3, and 6 remain properly connected, there should be no difference.

   Usage tips:
   * DO NOT PLUG THIS CABLE IN UPSIDE-DOWN!  You may damage internal
       components if you plug it incorrectly.
   * TURN OFF BOTH JAGUARS BEFORE CONNECTING.  You may damage internal
       components if you do not.
   * Since there isn't much strengh in the wires, remove the cable by the
       connectors.

Q. Agh!  My Jaguar is broken!  How can I fix it?
 
A. Unforutnately, with the dissolution of Atari Corp., repair or replacement
   of broken Jaguars is no longer available; Atari/JTS does not have any
   units remaining for sale or replacement.  On the other hand, with the low
   price of clearance Jaguars today, it isn't expensive to buy a new unit.

Q. How was development for the Jaguar done?
 
A. Jaguar game development environments existed for the Atari TT030 computer
   or an IBM PC/compatible.  Art development could be performed on any
   machine, whether a low-end Apple Macintosh or commercial rendering
   software such as SoftImage.  Wavefront's "GameWare" was the official 2D/3D
   graphics development system; Atari itself used GameWare for in-company
   development, and registered third-party Jaguar developers could buy
   GameWare licenses at special discount prices.

   Estimated price for a developer's package was $9,000 for the TT030 setup,
   and $7,500 for the PC/compatible platform.  The package included a Jaguar
   development unit, documentation, and development/debugging software.
   The Jaguar had modified boot firmware to run the development board (the
   "Alpine board"), and it had a cable coming out to provide signals to the
   Alpine board that are not normally present via the cartridge connector.

   CD-ROM developement packages (including the cartridge development kit)
   were ranged at about $8,000, and were upgradeable from the card-only kit.

   Software routines packaged with the system included a multi-channel
   polyphonic FM/Wavetable synth; JPEG decompression; video set-up; drawing
   primitives; 3D rendering with gourad shading, texture mapping, and camera
   manipulation.  GCC is the primary 68000 C compiler; support for other
   languages was not available from Atari, but developers were free to use
   whatever tools they may prefer.  The development toolkit ran under DOS,
   TOS, or Linux.  Work was proceeding on a Linux development system using
   the GNU tools.

   The centerpiece of the TT030 deveopment platform was DB, an assembly-
   language level debugging tool.  The Jaguar and the TT030 were connected
   with a parallel cable, and software could be debugged interactively
   without interfering with the Jaguar's screen display.  DB supported the
   use of scripts and aliases, which simplified the use of complex or common
   functions.

   Support for the development packages was primarily provided by Brainstorm
   (Atari France), who worked closely with Atari Corp.

   Atari granted final code approval, but did not see the need to "censor"
   games.  Every game was given one man-month of compatibility and quality
   testing before it was approved.  Atari offered technical support via FAX,
   mail, electronic mail and voice.  Atari allowed developers to source their
   own cartridges, documentation and shells if desired.  Jaguar software is
   encrypted with a proprietary key, thus preventing unauthorized developers
   from releasing Jaguar software.

   Cross Products (SNASM) offered an alternative Jaguar Development system.
   It came with a multiwindowed debugger, assemblers, compilers, and SCSI
   support, for approximately $3,700.  The package allowed for full screen,
   source level debugging of multiple processors, in C or assembler.  This
   was software only for the IBM PC; the Jaguar development hardware (Alpine
   board, modified Jaguar, etc.) had to be purchased separately from Atari.

   Ambitious hobbists have started their own unendorsed Jaguar development
   efforts, with several "home-brewed" development systems and electronic
   documentation of the Jaguar's inner workings.  Several games have been
   written for play on the "Jaguar Server" development system (requires some
   hardware modification to an existing Jaguar, and an IBM PC or Atari ST
   computer).
 
   Information about these efforts may be found on the web at the following
   sites:

Q. Where is the encryption key for Jaguar games?  Now that Hasbro has
   declared the Jaguar an "open system", the key should be available to the
   public, right?
 
A. Wrong.  Even though Hasbro has officially declared the Jaguar to be an
   "open" system, they have not released the encryption code for Jaguar games
   because they do not know what (or where) it is.  Hasbro's declaration of
   openness on the Jaguar simply means that developers and hackers are free
   to use any means they can to develop and sell Jaguar games -- whether they
   do this by figuring out the encryption key, bypassing the Jaguar's startup
   checks, or using any other techniques, Hasbro's lawyers will not bother
   anyone along the way.
 
   As of this writing, the unofficial word in the Jaguar community is that
   the few people who DO have access to the Jaguar's encryption key are
   trying to make sure that they're "safe" -- that if they release the keys,
   they won't be prosecuted by some other company for some other reason.
 
   But all hope is not lost!  According to Scott LeGrand of 4Play, former
   Atari engineer Dave Staugas has mentioned that the Jaguar's startup
   encryption check has a "back door" in the software -- a safety measure to
   be used in case the "real" encryption key was lost.  Investigation in this
   direction is currently continuing, and the latest (unconfirmed) theory is
   that the encryption (and the back door) works as follows:
 
     1. A 512-bit key is applied to the memory data, and then a 32-bit
        checksum is used for validation.
 
     2. The bottom 8K or so of ROM memory is filled with a key generated from
        the cartridge data.  When a Jaguar boots, this 8K of data is combined
        with the ROM data to generate the 32-bit checksum.
 
     3. If the checksum is valid, the cartridge is allowed to run.
 
     4. The "back door" checksum value is: 03D0 DEAD (hex).  And yes, it IS a
        cheeky reference to the Jaguar's then-current competitor...
 
   More details about the Jaguar encryption process will be added as it
   becomes publically available.  Scott, Carl, you know where to find me...
