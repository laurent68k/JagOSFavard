# CDGO.DB - script for controlled boot with the Jaguar CD
# or Emulator V2.10 or bigger
#
# Note: This assumes CDBOOT.ROM was loaded into Alpine 
# Space at 802000

# this installs the ROM code in Jaguar DRAM 
g802000,80206e

# this executes the bootcode from DRAM, installs the CDBIOS 
# and reads the table of contents to $2C00
g,50f22

# this goes until you bootcode is loaded from the first track in the 
# second session of your CD
g,3aec

# this executes the jump to your bootcode and stops with the 68k PC
# pointing to the first instruction of your bootcode
