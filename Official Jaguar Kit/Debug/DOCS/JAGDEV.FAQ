Frequently Asked Questions about the Jaguar Developer's Kit Tools
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Q: I don't understand something.

A: Please double-check the main printed documentation, as well as the 
   online updates to the documentation (like ALN.TXT and ADDENDUM.ALN for
   the ALN linker or MAC.TXT and ADDENDUM.MAC for the Madmac assembler).

   If you still have questions, then please contact Atari developer 
   support.



Q: I think I have found a bug or malfunction in MADMAC, ALN or RDBJAG/WDB.

A: First make sure you are using the most recent release of the program.
   The latest releases are officially released on the Atari Software Development
   BBS at (408) 745-2157 as well as on Compuserve (library 12 of the Atari Gaming
   forum).  Later versions not yet officially released may be available on the 
   Brainstorm BBS at +33 1 44670844.

   If you still have problems with the latest release, then please contact
   Mike Fulton at Atari, as well as Brainstorm, with as much information
   about the problem as you can.  A small chunk of stand-alone code that
   shows the problem is very helpful.


Q: I want to start immediately a nop project, just as a reality check,
   and I don't want to have to read all the documentation first.

A: First of all, please understand that we don't want to encourage people
   to try to jump in and do things without reading the documentation.  This
   can make you overlook important information later, because it makes you
   think you already know certain things and then you don't read the
   documentation.  Having said that, the basic steps are:

  1) Type in your program (NOP ...) and save it as NOP.S.
  
  2) Assemble it with MAC.EXE by typing in command line "mac -fb nop.s".
     Edit the program as necessary until it assembles without errors.

  3) Link the program with ALN.EXE by typing in the command line 
     "aln -e -a 4000 x x nop.o".  This will generate a Jaguar executable
     program file designed to execute at address $4000.
  
  4) Call the RDBJAG debugger by typing in the command line "rdbjag nop".
     This will load the debugger and tell it to look for an executable
     program with the filename of "nop" and an extension of either ".abs"
     or ".cof" (as produced by ALN).
  
  5) Step through the execution of your program using the "t" command in
     RDBJAG.  This is the trace command that executes one 68000 instruction
     and returns.



Q: When calling ALN during my make session, I have a make error:
   "Make error 2. ...".

A: This means you have to many arguments in your DOS command line. Use
   ALN's '-c <fname>' command line option instead.



Q: When calling ALN during my make session, I have a ALN warning:
   "Warning: DATA segment size of MYPROG is not a phrase multiple".

A: This means that the data segment of the program is not a multiple of
   8 bytes long.  This is a "phrase" which is an important memory boundary
   to certain parts of the Jaguar hardware.

   There are two ways around this.  First is to put a ".phrase" directive at
   the end of the DATA section in each source code file.  The second is to use
   the "-rp" directive with both Madmac and ALN, which tells them to automatically
   phrase-align each section of each file. 



Q: When I use ALN, I have warnings and/or errors about doubly defined
   labels but only their 8 first characters clash.

A: The default output format of MADMAC is Alcyon-format object modules,
   which have an 8-character symbol name length limitation.  To avoid
   this problem, use the BSD object module instead by specifying the 
   "-fb" command line option.


Q: When I use RDBJAG, symbols are truncated to 8 characters.

A: Either you have linked to an Alcyon-format executable file, or you
   have assembled using Alycon-format object modules.  Use the "-fb" 
   command line option with Madmac to specify the BSD object module format
   (with unlimited length symbol names) and use the "-e" option with ALN 
   to specify a COFF format executable with BSD symbols.
 


Q: I don't know if I have the source level debugging information.

A: Try 'mlist' under RDBJAG. If nothing happens, you're not in source level.



Q: I want to have the source level debugging information.

A: Use '-fb' and '-g' with MADMAC, '-e' and '-g' with ALN.



Q: I have an external label used in a MOVEI instruction and MADMAC says
   "Error: Illegal (GPU/DSP) relocation type."

A: The MOVEI instruction requires a special kind of relocation information
   not available with the Alcyon object module and executable file formats.
   Use BSD-format object modules instead by including "-fb" in your command line.


Q: I have an (not-orged) label used in a MOVEI instruction and MADMAC says
   "Error: Illegal (GPU/DSP) relocation type."

A: See above.



Q: I use a 'LIST' directive in my source, but no listing is output from
   Madmac.

A: Use the '-l' command line option.



Q: I define an 'EQUR' and MADMAC is not happy.

A: The EQUR directive can only be defined AND used in GPU/DSP sections.



Q: I use a 'NLIST' directive and MADMAC is not happy.

A: Use 'NOLIST' instead.



Q: I use a 'UNDEFMAC' directive and MADMAC is not happy.

A: Use 'MACUNDEF' instead.



Q: I use a 'PEVEN' directive and MADMAC is not happy.

A: Use 'PHRASE' instead.



Q: I use a 'ABS' instruction and MADMAC is not happy.

A: Use 'OFFSET' instead.



Q: Under RDBJAG, I have a small garbage following most of the ends of line.

A: Those are ANSI escape sequences. You need to load the ANSI.SYS driver.
   This is done by including a line such as that shown below in your CONFIG.SYS file.

   device=c:\dos\ansi.sys



Q: When I type in RDBJAG "load myprog.db", I have a "Not enough memory"
   error message, but I do have enough memory.

A: You're using an old version of FILEFIX.



Q: When I start RDBJAG, it prints "No bidirectional parallel port found!" and
   quits.

A:Try again. If it keeps giving this error message, then:

  1) Turn on the Jaguar :=).

  2) Check your parallel cable and connections.

  3) Check if your parallel board is really bidirectionnal with parallel.exe.

  4) If nothing works, contact us.



Q:Parallel.exe says that my parallel port is monodirectionnal, but the board's
  documentation pretends it to be bidirectional.

A: Try the following:

   1) Check the board configuration (switches, jumpers, etc...).
  
   2) Try the board on a different mother-board.
   
   3) Use another board.



Q: Parallel.exe says that my parallel port is bidirectionnal, but RDBJAG still
   doesn't see it.

A: Try again. If it sticks to this error message, then use '-p# -d' in RDBJAG's
   command line, where # is the desired port's number (1,2,3).



Q: I have more than one bidirectionnal parallel port, and I don't want
   RDBJAG to automatically use the first one.

A: Use '-p#' in RDBJAG's command line, where # is the desired port's number
   (1,2,3).



Q: I have a Jaguar plugged into LPT2, and I can't print on LPT1 after having
   started RDBJAG once.

A: Use '-p2 -d' with RDBJAG.


Q: I want to use the development kit on systems other than Atari or PC/MSDOS.

A: Some tools are also available for the Linux operating system.  Contact
   Atari for more information.



Q: I use a Sylvester on PC and RDBJAG doesn't work.

A: If you are using a Sylvester system, contact Atari immediately for an
   exchange.  This system is very out of date.



Q: I try to reset or stop the jaguar from inside the debugger, either by
   typing "reset" or "stop" in the command line or with the menu options, but
   it doesn't work.

A: If you're on an Atari system, this doesn't work.  If you're on a PC, then
   it's possible your Alpine board is correctly wired to support these commands.
   Please contact Atari for assistance.
