  Welcome to the Parallel Port Information Utility
-----------------------------------------------------

   Parallel is a simple utility which displays the configuration of the
   parallel ports (LPT ports) in your system. Parallel is useful for:

      1.  Configuring parallel port software such as Windows printer
          connections, parallel port device drivers, and print spoolers.

      2.  Resolving technical support problems with parallel port devices,
          including printers and external peripherals such as network
          adapters, portable disks, tape drives, CD-ROMs, floppies, etc.

      3.  Configuring your parallel ports for best performance.

      4.  Resolving pesky IO address and IRQ contention problems.

      5.  Discovering the performance capabilities of your parallel ports.

      6.  Learning how your particular system's CMOS configuration
          relates to the actual configuration of your parallel ports.

      7.  Making informed decisions when buying parallel ports and devices.

      8.  Getting the best parallel port performance for your dollar.

      9.  Experimenting with your parallel port configuration.

      10. Solving problems associated with print spoolers and network print
          capture programs which redirect printer output by changing the
          port mappings kept in the LPT Bios data area.

   Now is a good time for you to learn something about parallel ports,
   since parallel ports are becoming increasingly useful due to the recent
   explosion in the popularity of portable and external peripherals, and
   because new parallel port standards (EPP, ECP, IEEE 1284) are breaking
   performance barriers and allowing full bus speed operation. There are
   major performance differences between different types of ports and
   these differences are becoming of increasing significance to consumers.

   These applications of Parallel are dicussed in more detail below. But
   first let's take a quick look at how you run the program itself and
   interpret the various information it displays.

PARALLEL.DOC                                                              Page 1

------------------------------
  Quick Overview of Parallel
------------------------------

   Parallel operates by testing each of the standard addresses in your
   system where parallel ports might be found and gathering a broad
   assortment of useful information about the specific port behavior.
   Parallel tests the ports and then produces a compact display which
   is convenient and easy to read. You may need to refer to these
   instructions or the built-in reference screen a few times until you
   learn what the various columns of information mean.

   How to use Parallel:

   Step 1 => Disconnect parallel port peripherals (printers, disks, etc)
   Step 2 => Disable parallel port software (device drivers, spoolers, etc)
   Step 3 => Attach the optional loopback connector(s) for IRQ detection
   Step 4 => Run PARALLEL
   Step 5 => Read the display...

   Parallel will display five columns of information containing one or
   more lines about each port. The columns are:

        Port Type        The parallel port's IO capabilities. Types are:

                         No Port   --   No port is exists at the address
                         4 bit     --   A slow "unidirectional" port
                         8 bit     --   A faster "bidirectional" port
                         EPP       --   A very fast Enhanced Parallel Port

        Address          IO Base Address of the port (3BC, 378, 278)

        IRQ              Interrupt level associated with the port (5 or 7)

        BIOS Name        Logical device name of the port (LPT1, LPT2, LPT3)

        Notes            A wide assortment of comments, warnings, etc.


   Port Strangeness Factor. On a single line, after the columnar display,
   Parallel reports a magic number called the "Port Strangeness Factor".
   This is simply the total number of strange or unusual properties that
   Parallel has found when examining your configuration. If your ports are
   considered strange by Parallel, you might want to take some action
   to correct the situtation or at least be aware of the peculiarity.
   The Port Strangeness is not reported if your configuration is nominal.

  Detailed Program Operation
------------------------------


   Before running Parallel, temporarily remove all parallel port devices
   and software to establish a baseline configuration. Temporarily
   disconnect printers and other parallel port devices such as disks,
   network adapters, tape drives, etc, and disable any special parallel
   port software you may have running, like print spoolers or parallel
   port device drivers. The interaction of Parallel with external devices
   is discussed in some detail later on, and you may find that disconnecting
   these devices is simply not necessary in your configuration.

   Then, type PARALLEL at the command line.  Parallel will display the
   parallel port type, IO address, IRQ level, BIOS name equivalence, and
   an assortment of informative notes about your parallel ports.

   If you have a relatively slow PC, you may notice that Parallel produces
   a certain amount of temporary "debugging" output as it attempts to
   determine your port configuration and then overlays this output with
   the final display. This is normal and has been included in the first
   release of the program for possible support purposes.

   Type PARALLEL ? for a reminder screen on interpreting the display.

   If, perchance, the display scrolls off the screen, which might happen
   if Parallel is reporting extensive notes about interesting conditions
   on your ports, then use the MORE command or redirect Parallel's output
   to a file. Redirection to a file can also be handy if you need to fax
   Parallel's output to someone.

          PARALLEL | MORE          ; pauses the output every screen
          PARALLEL > filename      ; redirects output to a file

   Parallel works best when you disconnect any parallel port devices, such
   as printers, external peripherals, or "laplink" cables. Even our 4bit,
   8bit, or Univeral High-Speed Turbo cables for our handy parallel port
   network drivers (Pipx and Pndis) should be temporarily disconnected
   when you run Parallel, at least until you understand how Parallel can
   be affected by interference from devices attached to the port(s).
   Parallel may also affect active devices attached to parallel ports
   (printers, network adapters, external parallel port disks, etc),
   although we've made every attempt to minimize these effects. Parallel's
   interactions with devices are discussed in some detail below.

  Interpreting the Display
----------------------------

   Understanding the Port Type
   ---------------------------

   This can be 4bit, 8bit, EPP or No Port. We will add recognition for
   other ports such as Microsoft/HP ECP ports, and/or other IEEE 1284
   ports, as they begin to appear in end-user systems.

        No Port     No port was found at the given IO Address.

                    Parallel tests all the base addresses and displays at
                    least one line of information about each base address,
                    even if there is no port installed at that base address.

                    Parallel uses a rather more robust technique for
                    detecting a port than is used in any of the BIOSes we
                    have seen. This means that Parallel can detect ports
                    which fail the BIOS boot-time tests. Parallel uses a
                    rotating bit test and assumes the port exists if any of
                    the bits at the port location respond correctly.

                    False Positives.  Parallel can be fooled into thinking
                    that a port is present when it is not (false positive)
                    only if there is some other device which behaves like a
                    parallel port located at the address being tested.  We
                    have only seen this on one system, an off-shore 286
                    laptop which had several other design problems as well.

                    False Negatives.  There is one way in which Parallel
                    can be fooled into thinking that a port does not exist
                    (false negative). If an active device is connected to
                    the data lines and is providing enough power to
                    "overdrive" the port, then the port existance test will
                    fail because the incoming data from the device will
                    foil the readback test. We have only seen Parallel
                    produce false negatives when an external device is
                    actively driving the port's inputs or when the Loopback
                    is incorrectly installed. By the way, in this case, the
                    PC's BIOS will also fail to detect the port. Again,
                    Parallel works best when you disconnect any parallel
                    port devices.

        4bit ports  The port can do 8bit byte output and 4bit nibble input.

                    These ports are often called "unidirectional", and are
                    most commonly found on desktop bus cards (also called
                    IO expansion cards, serial/parallel cards, or even 2S+P
                    cards). This is still the most common type of port,
                    especially on desktop systems.

                    4bit ports are capable of effective transfer rates of
                    about 40 Kbytes/sec (KBPS) in typical devices and can
                    be pushed upwards of 80 KBPS with certain design
                    tricks. The port speed is also affected by electrical

                    characteristics of the noise suppression circuitry.
                    Some ports have completely ridiculous arrangements of
                    noise suppression circuits which slow them down quite
                    dramatically and can prevent their functioning with
                    parallel port peripherals.

             NOTE:  The sample transfer rates given here reflect the actual
                    performance of parallel port network adapters, disks,
                    etc. The raw transfer rate of the port itself is higher
                    but since most parallel devices use software strobing to
                    control data access, the effective transfer rate is
                    dependent on the quality of the driver software supplied
                    with the device. Due to the recent explosion in the
                    number of parallel port peripherals entering the market,
                    there is an extreme degree of variability in the quality
                    and performance of these devices and their drivers.

                    4bit ports are found on about 50% of all systems and
                    about 75% or more of desktop systems.

                    We do not recommend 4bit ports; 8bit ports are better.

             NOTE:  There is a class of "semi-bidirectional" parallel ports
                    which appear to the PC to be 4bit ports, but actually
                    have 8bit capability when they are connected to
                    external devices with strong drivers. These include
                    the original PC/AT parallel port. Parallel will report
                    these ports as 4bit ports but they may actually function
                    as 8bit ports with a few parallel port peripherals.

                    A good example of a peripheral which handles these ports
                    well are IQ Technologies' parallel port network adapters.

                    It is actually possible to identify this type of port
                    using a side-effect of Parallel's loopback test. See
                    the special section below on Semi-Bidirectional ports.


        8bit ports  These ports can do both 8bit input and output.

                    These ports are sometimes called "bidirectional ports",
                    but that term is often misused by some vendors to refer
                    to 4bit ports as well. Most newer laptops have 8bit
                    capability although it may need to be enabled with the
                    laptop's vendor-specific CMOS setup function. This is
                    discussed below. A relatively smaller percentage of LPT
                    bus cards have 8bit capability which sometimes must be
                    enabled with a hardware jumper on the board itself.

                    True 8bit ports are preferable to 4bit ports because
                    they are considerably faster when used with external
                    devices that take advantage of 8BIT capability.

                    8bit ports are capable of speeds ranging from 80-150
                    KBPS, again depending on the speed of the attached
                    device, the quality of the driver software, and on the
                    port's electrical characteristics.  8bit ports are

                    found on 25% of desktops, 50% of laptops, and about
                    90% of newer laptops built since 1991.

           CAVEAT:  A number of vendors claim "bidirectional" capability
           EMPTOR   for their parallel ports when they are actually just
                    4bit ports. When buying a parallel port expansion card,
                    or an entire system, you might want to use Parallel to
                    find out the REAL capabilities of the port. Be aware
                    that a vendor's reputation for quality in other areas
                    may not translate into good parallel ports.  There are
                    examples of well-known vendors making false claims for
                    their parallel ports... sometimes, it appears, simply
                    because they don't understand them... claims or ports.

                    Of the 8bit add-in LPT cards we have tested, we like the
                    Everex MagicIO the best, but it can be hard to find.

                    We are not going to pan anyone's "bidirectional" add-in
                    cards specifically, but be warned that the use of terms
                    like "bidirectional" or "PS/2 compatible" may have
                    nothing to do with the port's actual IO capability.
                    You can use Parallel to test add-in cards to determine
                    the parallel port's IO actual behavior.

        EPP ports   Can do both 8bit input and output at bus speeds.

                    These ports are as fast as 8bit bus cards and can
                    achieve transfer rates of 1 Mbyte/sec and faster. For
                    example, our EPP-capable external SCSI disk is faster
                    on a very popular SL laptop than it's internal drive.
                    EPP ports are supposed to conform to a well defined
                    electrical standard and many of them actually do so.
                    However, if you are buying a laptop and want to be sure
                    of using fast EPP-capable external peripherals, then
                    definitely arrange to try before you buy.

                    Xircom has been active in creating and defining the EPP
                    standard, and since their EPP-capable network adapters
                    are fairly common, it's worth mentioning that these
                    adapters can be used as a practical benchmark for the
                    goodness of a particular EPP port. Crude but effective.

                    EPP ports are most often found on laptops using the
                    Intel 386SL chipset with the 360SL IO support chip. You
                    can usually identify these laptops by the 'SL' suffix
                    in their name, HOWEVER this is not a hard and fast
                    rule, since there are non-'SL' systems with EPP ports
                    as well as 'SL' systems which (in our tests) have non-
                    functioning or sub-standard EPP ports.  Other vendors
                    offer add-in EPP cards for the ISA bus. Parallel will
                    not currently recognize non-Intel EPP ports; we will be
                    adding this feature in the near future. We know of one
                    vendor now offering EPP-capable add-in cards:

                         FarPoint Communications       805-726-4420

                    The FarPoint card is quite nice because it is a "soft"

                    design with downloadable personalities. It comes with
                    support for fast Windows printing and a fast Netware
                    spooling NLM. We like it.

                    SMC's Component Products Division is due to release
                    EPP and ECP chips in the very near future, so users
                    can expect to see EPP and ECP capabilities become
                    available on a wider range of systems.

           HOW TO:  Run Parallel on any system you intend to buy to see
                    what kind of parallel port(s) are provided.  If you are
                    buying a desktop with a built-in LPT card, try to get
                    real 8bit capability instead of the more typical 4bit.
                    Some LPT cards have hardware jumpers that are required
                    to enable the bidirectional behavior. So make sure you
                    get a manual for the LPT card when you buy a system.

                    If you are buying a laptop and have any desire to use
                    external peripherals like network adapters, portable
                    hard disks, CD-ROMS, tape drives, etc, then seriously
                    consider getting a laptop with an EPP port. They are a
                    LOT faster running EPP-capable external peripherals. In
                    any case, try before you buy. Few vendors (and users)
                    are well-informed about parallel port technology and
                    inappropriate claims, however inadvertant, are common.

         COMING:    Microsoft, Hewlett-Packard, and others are espousing a
         SOON --    new standard for parallel ports, the ECP port, which is
         ECP PORTS  may become part of the proposed IEEE 1284 specification,
                    which also covers EPP. Some vendors are reported to
                    have silicon for this port, but we haven't seen it in
                    any end-user systems yet. The ECP port is pretty much
                    the same as EPP ports in terms of performance but uses
                    a quite different hardware design. The major difference
                    is that ECP has Microsoft's blessing and they will
                    probably support it (but perhaps only in Windows) if it
                    actually materializes. Quite typically, there is no
                    guarantee that MS will ever support EPP.

                    When using Parallel to make buying decisions, please
                    make sure you've got the most recent release. Parallel
                    port technology will be changing rapidly over the next
                    year and we will be updating Parallel frequently.

   Understanding the IO Address
   ----------------------------

   This is the base address of the port. It will be 3BC, 378, or 278 hex.
   The IO address specifies the port's location in the PC address space.

   Normally the first port is configured to 3BC, the second to 378, etc,
   however the ports can be assigned to any of these three addresses.

   On bus cards, the IO address is usually set by a arrangement of jumpers
   unique to the particular board. You will need a manual or the ability
   to read PC board traces (gacck!). These jumpers are usually arranged to
   allow you to select one of three addresses: 3BC, 378, 278.

   Sometimes these addresses are called by the "logical device names" of
   LPT1, LPT2, and LPT3, although this practice is quite misleading (see
   BIOS discussion below). Some boards offer a more limited selection of
   configurations (usually 378 and 278) and a few are actually hardwired
   to a specific address. Vendors do this to save a little money and also
   to eliminate the chance of creating an address collision with the
   "standard" address of 3BC. Because of the increasing number of clones
   which are assembled from various components, we often see systems with
   one LPT card, configured to address 378. In fact, a fair number of
   systems are shipped with this 378 configuration.

   A slightly interesting result we've seen in several desktops spins off
   when someone adds a second LPT card to a system which already has a LPT
   at 378, IRQ 7. Sometimes they naively reason that since 378 is taken,
   they can use 3BC and slap in the card without checking the IRQ level.
   This creates a configuration of 3BC and 378 both using IRQ 7, a
   situation which can lead to intermittent crashes when using interrupt
   driven parallel port software.

   By the way, a few systems have parallel ports and com ports built onto
   the motherboard itself and, in this case, the configuration jumpers
   will be found on the motherboard.

   Notice that there are three commonly used IO Addresses (3BC, 378, 278)
   and two available interrupt levels (IRQ 7 and IRQ 5). This means that
   if you have three LPT cards in a system, two of them will probably be
   sharing a hardware interrupt level. This is hardwarily permissible, and
   generally doesn't create any problems since most DOS and Windows
   software doesn't use interrupts for printing anyway. However, if you
   are using LPT software like an interrupt-driven print spooler or
   interrupt-driven LPT devices like external hard disks, external network
   adapters, and so forth, then you have to be sure that either (1) the
   ports are not using the same interrupt level, or (2) the software is
   capable of "interrupt sharing".

   When adding or configuring LPT cards, we suggest using 3BC, IRQ 7 for
   the first card; 378, IRQ 5 for the second card; and 278, no IRQ for the
   third card. This gives you two interrupt-capable LPT ports, and one
   port (at 278) which you should use only for non-interrupt driven usage,
   like the status-driven spooling provided by DOS.

   In any case, armed with this understanding and the Parallel Utility,
   you are equipped to select a configuration which works for you.

           HOW TO:  The IO ADDRESS is a standard parameter in network
                    configuration files where it takes on different names
                    and syntaxes to confuse innocent users.

                    Some simple-minded parallel port peripherals (ones
                    without auto-configuring capability) require that you
                    specify the IO address, IRQ level, and sometimes the
                    Port Type in a vendor-specific way. Parallel provides
                    you with this information. See Configuring Networks and
                    Devices below.

           HOW TO:  Resolving IO Address conflicts is usually fairly simple,
                    since it is rare to find a device which uses the
                    standard parallel port addresses.

                    A good procedure for eliminating potential IO address
                    conflicts when installing parallel port add-in boards
                    is to remove all the boards, install one, use Parallel
                    to see what addresses it finds, install the next, and
                    so forth.  If Parallel finds each board at a separate
                    addresses as you install them, then you can be sure of
                    your configuration.

   Understanding the IRQ Level
   ---------------------------

   This is the hardware interrupt level assigned to the port. It will
   always be either 7 or 5. Parallel displays "?" when it cannot detect
   the IRQ level of the port and "-" when the port doesn't exist. Parallel
   needs an external loopback connector to automatically detect the IRQ.
   With appropriate precautions (described in horrible and excruciating
   detail below) you can use a simple paperclip as a loopback connector.

   Normally IRQ 7 is assigned to the first port and IRQ 5 is assigned to
   the second port. However, due to the explosion of clones assembled from
   disparate parts, it is not uncommon to see systems with one LPT port
   located at 378 with an IRQ of 7 or 5. This is because clones are often
   assembled using offshore add-in LPT cards which are shipped configured
   to operate as a second LPT card.

   This is a good time to point out that there are few hard and fast rules
   when it comes to parallel port configuration. Ports can be located at any
   one of the three standard base address and can use either of the IRQ
   levels. If you are developing parallel port software, you should auto-
   detect the actual configuration rather than assume any standard usage.
   We offer libraries and source code for this purpose. Here at Parallel
   Technologies, we test our software using many strange configurations and
   delight in adding idiosyncratic ports to our extensive collection.

   The most common idiosyncrasy of port IRQ is IRQ inversion.  The PC
   standard calls for interrupts to be generated on 0->1 transitions of
   the interrupt line.  A small percentage of parallel ports generate
   their interrupts on 1->0 transitions.  Ports with inverted IRQ can
   fail to operate with some interrupt software, particularly certain
   external network adapters, disks, and so forth. Parallel identifies
   these ports with a note "IRQ style is INVERTED".

   Some parallel ports have non-functioning IRQ lines. They are simply not
   capable of generating interrupts. Only a very few pieces of software
   are capable of dealing with these ports by using a polled mode of
   operation. It is sometimes possible to repair such systems by jumpering
   the interrupt enable line to the parallel port chip.

   On ISA cards (bus cards in ISA slots) the interrupt level is usually
   set with jumpers on the board - these jumpers are different for every
   card so you need to hunt around for the manual in order to change them.
   If you're lucky there will be readable labels on the card itself.

   On laptops, the interrupt level can usually be set using the vendor's
   specific CMOS configuration (setup) program. Sometimes these CMOS setup
   programs are built into the ROM; sometimes they exist as separate
   programs or as part of the vendor's diagnostic program(s). Refer to
   your manual to find out how to enter the CMOS setup mode. BE CAREFUL
   when using the CMOS setup, since it gives you access to parameters that
   can disable your system if wrongly changed. KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING.

                            ******************

          Misuse of your system's CMOS setup program can prevent
          your system from operating correctly, or in some cases,
          from operating at all! Be sure you know what you are
          doing; read your user's manual or get qualified help if
          you have any doubts.

   Another strange feature of these software configurable ports is that
   they often have very peculiar ideas about nomenclature. Often these
   CMOS setup programs use vendor specific "magic code words" to select
   various parallel port configurations, and these magic words can have
   non-obvious effects. Sometimes the vendor's manuals don't even provide
   a secret decoder ring to explain what their magic words really mean in
   terms of IO Address, IRQ, and Port Type. Parallel will be useful for
   determining the actual effect of the CMOS setup choices on your system.

   For example, on my Dell NL25 laptop, 4bit mode is called "Normal" and
   8bit is called "Enhanced" and there is no choice at all for the real
   Enhanced Parallel Port (the SL's EPP port). So someone might obviously
   think they have enabled EPP by choosing "Enhanced". Futhermore, the IRQ
   level cannot be set directly, but rather is set as a by-product of
   selecting combinations of the IO address and the Port Type. Most of the
   choices on my Dell yield IRQ 7, but one lonely choice - LPT1, 278,
   Normal mode results in IRQ 5. It makes a strange sort of sense when you
   are experienced with parallel ports, but is likely to be confusing to
   the average user (if we ever find him, or her). The Dell is not alone
   in it's strange naming conventions, most laptops have confusing,
   misleading, or incomplete labels and controls in their CMOS setup
   programs. This sort of indirect control in very common in CMOS setups
   and creates a lot of tech support calls from frustrated users.

   In addition, most SL laptops don't have the capability to enable their
   EPP ports from CMOS. Usually you need to run a separate vendor-supplied
   BIOS extension to enable EPP capability. These take the form of a tiny
   TSR which adds INT 17h BIOS extensions for controlling the EPP port,
   and handles command line arguments for enabling and disabling EPP. An
   interesting sidelight of switching into EPP mode can be that your port
   IO address may change on the fly. The Intel EPP hardware allows EPP
   ports to be configured at IO Addresses 378 and 278. So if you have set
   your port address to 3BC (with CMOS for example) and then switch into
   EPP mode, your port will appear to have moved.

   Parallel will come in handy in trying to make sense of what your
   laptops' CMOS settings are actually doing to your parallel ports.

   Understanding the BIOS Name
   ---------------------------

   This is the "human-readable" (hah!) name which you use to refer to the
   port when using DOS commands, Windows picklists, and so forth. It will
   be one of the following: LPT1, LPT2, LPT3.  LPT4 is extremely rare and
   Parallel currently ignores it.

   The port address is NOT the same as the BIOS name for the port. For
   example, LPT1 can refer to a port at 3BC, 378, or 278.

   So, how does the BIOS associate the LPT names with the actual ports?

   Whenever your system boots, the BIOS goes out and tries to write and
   readback data from locations 3BC, 378, and 278. If it can read back
   what it writes, then the BIOS decides there is a port there and adds
   the IO address to a LPT table in the "Bios Data Area". This table is
   four words located at 40:8. A command like "copy foo.txt lpt2:" means
   "copy the file foo.txt to the second printer that BIOS knows" and DOS
   uses a software interrupt, INT 17h, to do just that. INT 17h looks in
   the Bios Data area to find out the IO address of the "second printer",
   which can be any of the IO Addresses - 3BC, 378, or 278.

   The result is that LPT1 refers to the first port BIOS finds at boot
   time, wherever it may be. So "LPT1" means "the first printer", not
   necessarily 3BC, 378, or 278. Some BIOSes have unique methods for
   finding their LPT ports.

   When you see LPT1, LPT2, or LPT3 used in hardware manuals to refer to
   port locations, be alert for possible misleading information. Some
   well-known vendor's manuals use LPT1 to refer to 378 and LPT2 to refer
   to 278, an entirely spurious practice which has confused many users.

   It is possible for some parallel port software to set the port into an
   IO mode that causes it to fail the BIOS test and seem to "disappear"
   from your system even after a soft boot (CTRL-ALT-DEL). Parallel has a
   better test, and finds such ports. A hard reset (a power-off reset)
   will clear the port. Parallel ports are not completely trivial devices;
   they have a number of states that can affect their operation. So if you
   are having a parallel port problem, one of the first things to do a
   power-off reset.

   Another factor here is that various programs can fiddle with the
   LPT table. The utility SWAPPRT, for example, can be used to swap
   LPTx with LPTy which it does by moving the entries in the LPT table.
   There are variations of this redirection theme.

   If Parallel does not display a BIOS name for a port, that means the
   IO Address for that LPT position has been replaced with a value that
   does not match a valid hardware port.  Some parallel port device
   drivers do this as a way to grab possesion of the port and prevent
   other software from writing to the port while the driver is installed.

   Understanding the Notes and Comments
   ------------------------------------

   The "Notes" field of the display will contain various comments,
   depending on what Parallel has detected. Each note may be followed by
   one or more comments giving further information or directions. These
   secondary comments are indented one space under their note.

   "No port found at this address"

                    No parallel port is installed at this IO Address.

                    However, it is also possible that an active external
                    device is overdriving the port's inputs, which can
                    prevent the software readback test from working.

                    Be sure that you have disconnected all external devices.

   "Need loopback to determine IRQ"

                    The port exists, but does not respond to attempts to
                    generate IRQs. This is because a loopback connector
                    is required for IRQ detection in most cases.

   "Port IRQs are not functioning"

                    This is pretty bad. It means that the loopback connector
                    is present and working correctly, but Parallel still
                    can't generate any interrupts. Technically it means
                    that transitions in the ACK line don't affect the PIC.
                    Practically it means that interrupt devices and software
                    probably won't work, unless they have polling support.

                    Possible reasons for failing the IRQ test include:

                        1. The port's interrupt capability is disabled

                           Check your CMOS configuration and/or the
                           hardware jumpers on the parallel port board(s)
                           to be sure that the interrupt is enabled.
                           The function of CMOS parameters and/or hardware
                           jumpers varies from system to system, so check
                           your manual or contact your vendor if you have
                           problems enabling the port's interrupt line.

                           Note that most CMOS and jumper arrangements
                           combine enabling the IRQ with selecting the
                           level, ie, "enable IRQ5" or "enable IRQ7".
                           Removing the jumper generally disables IRQ.

                        2. The port does not have IRQ capability

                           Most ports DO have interrupt capability,
                           but a small percentage (at a guess %1 to %5)
                           do not. More laptops lack interrupts than
                           add-in cards. Add-in cards without IRQ are rare.
                           Most reports of non-functional parallel port

                           IRQs in desktop systems can be tracked to
                           configuration problems which create interrupt
                           conflicts (see #3) which effectively disable IRQ.

                        3. There is an IRQ conflict with another device

                           It is possible that another device in your
                           system is preventing the parallel port IRQs
                           from functioning.  For example, in IBM-PCs
                           and XTs, the disk controller which uses IRQ 5
                           can prevent parallel ports configured to IRQ5
                           from creating interrupts.

                    To isolate this problem, remove all boards from the
                    system that are not required to perform the test.
                    In other words, strip down to just the parallel port,
                    floppy controller and video, and repeat the test.

                    If possible, configure the parallel port to IRQ7.
                    If the port can create IRQ7 interrupts, but not IRQ5
                    interrupts, then an interrupt conflict is likely.

   "IRQ determined by loopback"

                    The loopback was detected, is operating correctly,
                    and the port's IRQs are functioning correctly. The
                    IRQ level found is given in the IRQ column.

   "IRQ estimated by port float"

                    No loopback connector was detected, but the port is
                    generating IRQs anyway. This probably means that the
                    port is connected to an inactive (unpowered) external
                    device. Treat IRQs determined in this way with some
                    skepticism; better to disconnect the device and use a
                    loopback connector.

   "IRQ determined by EPP hardware"

                    If the Port Type is determined to be EPP, then Parallel
                    does not use the IRQ test, but rather reports the IRQ
                    which is standard for an EPP port at that IO Address.

   "IRQ noise is present"

                    Parallel has detected extraneous interrupts occuring
                    on IRQ level 5 or 7 during the IRQ test.

                    This condition is reported when the total number of
                    interrupts occurring on both IRQ5 and IRQ7 exceeds
                    the number of interrupts Parallel tests for.

                    This can mean several things:

                        1. PIC errors. The PC's interrupt controller (PIC)
                           is generating errors as described below.


PARALLEL.DOC                                                             Page 16

Parallel Port Information Utility  ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ  User's Manual



                        2. An active device other than the parallel port
                           is generating interrupts on IRQ 5 or 7.

                        3. The port's interrupt line is electrically noisy.
                           This has been seen with boards which have two
                           parallel ports where transitions in one port's
                           IRQ line causes noise on the other port's IRQ.

                    This result may be ignored if you are not having any
                    problems, but be informed that this condition is quite
                    likely to confuse parallel port software which tries
                    to autodetect the port's IRQ level.

    TECHNICAL NOTE: PIC errors are usually found with parallel port chips
                    whose "open" condition on the ACK line may allow the
                    IRQ signal to float randomly. This effect creates
                    8259 interrupt controller errors which are directed to
                    IRQ7 where they can be mistaken for "real" interrupts.
                    This effect may confuse some parallel port software.

                    An 8259 error condition is defined to occur when the
                    8259 attempts to service the requesting device but the
                    device's interrupt line has gone inactive.  These
                    are also known as "lost interrupts", which are not
                    really lost but rather redirected to IRQ7. A noisy IRQ
                    line can create the appearance of lost interrupts.

                    This effect of lost interrupts explains why some
                    parallel port driver software works well on IRQ7 but
                    not IRQ5, or vice versa. Parallel port interrupt
                    handlers have to account for conditions that are
                    generally not seen by other device drivers. So if you
                    are having problems with a parallel port device driver
                    you may want to try configuring the port to the other
                    interrupt level.

   "NOTE: Data port has stuck bits!"

                    The rotating bit test has detected bits in the data
                    port which cannot be set or cleared properly.

                    You have probably inserted the Loopback incorrectly.

                    Of course if there is no Loopback wire present, then
                    something else must be happening! It could be that an
                    active device is forcing some of the data lines to a
                    fixed level. It could also mean that your port exists,
                    but some of the data bits are not working, which is a
                    polite way of saying that your port may be busted.

                    Parallel may report a false Port Type in this case.

                    Make sure that the loopback, if used, is correct. Make
                    sure that no devices are plugged into the port.

   "IRQ style is INVERTED"


PARALLEL.DOC                                                             Page 17

                    The port's IRQ line functions in an opposite sense from
                    the PC standard. A significant amount of software will
                    fail to work with such ports. There is no remedy for
                    this condition in general; the best we can advise is to
                    use a different port if you have a bus system or try
                    other CMOS settings on a laptop if that is possible.
                    You might try contacting your vendor.

                    Parallel may falsely report inverted IRQ if there is
                    an external device connected to the port.

   "Possible IRQ Conflict"

                    Two or more ports in your system are using the same IRQ
                    level. If you are not using interrupt-driven parallel
                    port peripherals or printing software then you might
                    simply ignore the warning if you are not experiencing
                    any problems. However, you should know that some very
                    strange results can occur when two parallel ports are
                    trying to drive the same IRQ line. Sometimes one or both
                    ports can falsely appear to have INVERTED IRQ.

                    The best solution is to move one of the ports to another
                    IRQ level, if that is possible.

    "BIOS Data doesn't match hardware"

                    The contents of the BIOS Data Area LPT Table does not
                    correspond to the expected initial state at boot time.

                    This is probably due to a parallel port device driver
                    or a SWAPLPT program having fiddled with the BIOS data,
                    in which case it may be considered normal operation.

                    This information is useful if you are having problems
                    with print redirection. Also, some parallel port device
                    drivers do not examine the hardware directly to determine
                    which ports exist, but rather only look at the BIOS.
                    If you have run some other parallel port software which
                    has changed the BIOS in a non-standard way, then these
                    device drivers may fail to find any parallel ports, or
                    may try to access the wrong port. This can often be
                    solved by changing the order of loading or by manually
                    configuring the failing driver.

---------------------------
  Automatic IRQ detection
---------------------------

   Parallel uses two methods for automatic detection of a port's IRQ
   level: port float or the external loopback connector.

   Understanding Port Float
   ------------------------

   Many parallel ports will "float" in a unstable logic state when
   connected to an unpowered external device such as a printer. This
   unstable logic state may cause the port to generate a limitless stream
   of apparent interrupts to the CPU if the port's interrupt line is
   enabled. This peculiar behavior is used to advantage by Parallel.

   If you have a unpowered (powered off) printer, or other device,
   attached to a port, then Parallel may be able to detect the interrupt
   level using this floating port behavior. In this case, Parallel will
   display "IRQ determined by port float". You should treat the IRQ
   determined in this way as a "best guess". To be sure of the IRQ,
   you need to disconnect the floating device and use loopback.

   In some cases, attaching a unpowered device to a port will enable
   Parallel to detect IRQ by loopback, since the combination of port and
   device appears indistinguishable from a loopback connector to Parallel.

   FLOAT NOTE: Powered on devices usually hold the interrupt line in a
   stable state and prevent IRQ autodetection. It is best to disconnect
   your parallel port device(s) and use the loopback connector when you
   need the absolute best results from Parallel.

   EXAMPLE: On my home system, an unpowered HP LaserJet II printer on an
   8bit port "floats" and Parallel reliably reports IRQ5. Attached to a
   4bit port on the same system, the LaserJet is indistinguishable from a
   loopback connector.  So turning the LaserJet off converts it into an
   expensive, but handy, paperclip. Turning it on prevents IRQ detection.

   TECHNICAL NOTE: Whether or not a given device and port combination will
   float, emulate loopback, or be invisible to Parallel is determined by
   the pull-ups on each end, CMOS vs TTL logic behavior, and the power
   available at the port to a unpowered device. In the above example, I
   suspect that enough power is provided by the 8bit TTL port to drive the
   unpowered CMOS logic in the LaserJet into an unstable oscillating
   state, which appears to the system as a frenzy of level 5 IRQs.

   Port float is a handy effect, but use Loopback for best results.

   Loopback
   --------

   The most reliable way to determine IRQ is to use an external
   loopback connection. Loopback is described in the next section.

  IRQ detection using the LoopBack Feature
--------------------------------------------

                              ******************
                              * IMPORTANT NOTE *
                              ******************

   First, DECIDE NOT TO SCREW UP YOUR PORT by crudely jamming wires into
   the wrong places with too much force.  REMEMBER that the female DB-25
   connector is likely to be made out of CHEAP, BREAKABLE PLASTIC, so
   decide right now not to break it. WE ARE NOT LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGE YOU
   MAY DO FOR WHATEVER REASON.

   The danger is that you will push too hard when inserting the loopback
   wire and force the female connector pin out of its position in the DB-
   25 shell. That is why WE SUGGEST MAKING A LOOPBACK PLUG using a male
   DB-25 connector as described below. If you cannot make a loopback plug,
   then use a parallel port extension cable instead. This protects your
   port from physical damage and also makes it a lot easier to work with.

   The port is supposed to be electrically designed to tolerate the
   loopback perfectly well. However there is a DANGER OF DAMAGE BY STATIC
   DISCHARGE so make sure that you GROUND YOURSELF TO THE PORT before
   inserting the loopback wire. It would be terrible if you blew out a
   $25 parallel port on a $1000 486 motherboard simply because you failed
   to PAY ATTENTION TO THESE PRECAUTIONS. PROCEED AT YOUR OWN RISK.

   The other danger is that you will apply the loopback to a port which is
   not really a parallel port at all. DON'T DO THIS. If you are not sure
   of what you are doing STOP RIGHT NOW. We have no control over what you
   might damage if you try this with a port other than a parallel port.

   Whew... on with the instructions.

      1.  Find the parallel port(s) you want to test. They will be female
          DB-25 connectors. MAKE SURE THAT YOU HAVE CORRECTLY IDENTIFIED
          THE PARALLEL PORT. Disconnect any devices (printers, network
          adapters, external disks, etc) which might be attached to other
          parallel ports on your system.

      2.  Make sure that the connector IS NOT SOME OTHER TYPE OF CONNECTOR
          like an external SCSI connector or a COM port.

          SCSI ports can be either female DB-25s or a larger connector,
          like a 37, 40, or 50-pin connector. COM ports are usually male
          DB-25 or small male DB-9 connectors, but this is not guaranteed.

          Look in your manual if there is any doubt. DON'T PROCEED unless
          you are sure you have identified the parallel port(s) correctly.

      3. Connect the Loopback Plug and go to Step 7.

          If you do not have a Loopback Plug, use a straight through M-F
          parallel port extension cable to prevent damage to your port.
          Connect the male end of the extension cable to your port and
          place the loopback wire into the female end of the cable.

PARALLEL.DOC                                                             Page 20

      4.  Identify Pin 10 and Pin 9 on the female end of the extension
          cable. Refer to the illustration below. Notice that a DB-25
          connector is wider on one side.  The pins you want are the 4th
          and 5th from the left on the wider edge.

          USE A FLASHLIGHT TO FIND THE MARKINGS IF YOU HAVE ANY DOUBT.

        Front View         -------- Pin 10 - 4th from left on wider edge
        Female DB-25       |   ---- Pin  9 - 5th from left on wider edge
        Connector          |   |
                           v   v
         ____________________________________________________________
        /                                                            \
        \     13  12  11  10   9   8   7   6   5   4   3   2   1     /
         \                                                          /
          \     25  24  23  22  21  20  19  18  17  16  15  14     /
           \______________________________________________________/

                  Pin 10 is the interrupt line (the ACK line)
                  Pin  9 is the high order data line (the 80h bit)

      4.  Create a loopback wire. A standard paperclip works fine. Just
          straighten it out and bend it into a "U" shape with the ends 1/8
          inch apart. Make sure the ends of the paperclip are SMOOTH and
          have NO ROUGH EDGES that might damage the plastic connector.

      5.  GROUND YOURSELF to the PC and to the parallel port by touching
          your hand and the loopback wire first to the PC's metal chassis
          near the parallel port connector and then to one of the connector
          nuts or the connector metal housing itself. Do this to DISCHARGE
          ANY STATIC ELECTRICITY you may have about you (created for
          example by scooting across the rug in a silk negligee on the
          way to your PC or by stroking your cat with woolen gloves).

          Parallel ports are usually resistant to static discharge, but not
          all ports are created equally, so don't ask for trouble.

      6.  Carefully insert the paperclip into the extension cable's DB-25
          connector so that Pin 9 is connected to Pin 10. DON'T FORCE IT.
          It will insert at most about 1 quarter of an inch (about .5 cm)
          and there should be absolutely no physical resistance.

      7.  Now run Parallel. It will automatically use the loopback to
          determine which IRQ level the port is actually using. You may
          loopback more than one, or all, ports at the same time.

      8.  Remove the loopback when you are done.

      9.  Congratulate yourself on using reasonable handling precautions
          when working with expensive equipment.

--------------------------------------
  Making Your Own Loopback Connector
--------------------------------------

   We strongly advise that you make a loopback connector, inside of using
   the expedient paperclip approach.

   Simply obtain a male DB-25 connector and solder a permanent connection
   bewteen Pin 9 to Pin 10 on the back of the connector.

   Male DB-25 connectors are inexpensive and commonly available in
   electronics parts stores.

   This will prevent any physical damage to your port, which is the major
   source of risk with this procedure, and the reason for our incessant
   nagging about precautions. This sort of loopback connector will be no
   more dangerous to your system than a printer, and is a handy accessory
   if you frequently use Parallel.

                                  Connect Pin 10 to Pin 9

  Semi-Bidirectional Ports, A Special Case
--------------------------------------------

   A port is semi-bidirectional when it is capable of performing 8BIT
   input when connected to a device which has strong drivers. So this
   semi-bidirectionality comes about as the relationship between the
   port and the device it is connected to.

   This type of port will appear to be a 4BIT port with most parallel
   port external peripherals, since low power CMOS drivers are by far
   the most common in these external devices.

   A few peripherals have stronger TTL drivers which can achieve 8BIT
   operation by overdriving the port. There are even sub-classes of
   ports which can achieve the effect depending on what data is used.

   Some vendors describe their ports as bidirectional when actually
   they are only semi-bidirectional and will only function as 4BIT ports
   with most peripherals. True 8BIT ports are preferable because they
   have a significant speed advantage with most external peripherals.
   Indeed, some parallel port peripherals require true 8BIT capability.


   Identifying semi-bidirectional ports
   ------------------------------------

   Step 0  =>   Read the cautions and disclaimers applying to loopback

   Step 1  =>   Select the port to test. The test only applies to 4BIT ports.

   Step 2  =>   Attach a parallel port extension cable to the port

   Step 3  =>   At the female DB-25 end, loopback Pin 8 to Pin 21 (GND).

   Step 4  =>   Run Parallel

   Step 5  =>   If Parallel reports "Data port has stuck bits" then the
                port is likely to have semi-bidirectional capability.

   We will probably build this test into the next version of Parallel.

  Using Parallel to Manually Configure Parallel Port Peripherals
-----------------------------------------------------------------

   With the information that Parallel reports, you are equipped
   to perform manual configuration of network adapters and other
   parallel port peripheral devices, should they require such manual
   configuration. Here are a few examples of how Parallel's IO address
   and IRQ level are used in popular network software configuration
   files when them for use with parallel port adapters.

   Note that these examples also apply to our Pipx and Pndis drivers
   which allow Netware Lite, Windows for Workgoups, and Lan Manager
   networking using simple parallel port cables between two systems.
   TestDrive versions of Pipx and Pndis are available on Compuserve,
   or you can buy the commercial versions directly from us. These
   drivers allow you to use your favorite network software between
   two systems through the parallel port, without network adapters.
   This is a handy capability for laptops, and in other situations
   where you need truely portable and universal networking at low cost.
   Pipx and Pndis support several different types of cables, ranging
   from the low-performance "laplink" type cable you may already
   have up to our fabulous Universal High-Speed Turbo Cable (wow!)
   which can do parallel port networking at 200 Kbytes/sec or more.

   In the following examples, assume Parallel has reported a parallel
   port at IO address 3BC, IRQ 7.

   These examples are not meant to be cookbook instructions, but
   are offered to give you a feel for how to apply the information
   displayed by Parallel. Other manual configuration parameters may or not
   not be supported by specific vendors as custom keywords. Examples
   are: IOMODE, IRQMODE, CABLETYPE, PORTTYPE, BITMODE, and so forth.

   Netware NET.CFG file for ODI drivers
   ------------------------------------

          PORT 3BC
          INT  7

   Lan Manager or Windows Workgroups PROTOCOL.INI file
   ---------------------------------------------------

          IOBASE = 0x3BC
          IRQ = 7


   Other device configuration files and programs
   ---------------------------------------------

   If you are having trouble installing a parallel port peripheral, be
   prepared to run Parallel when calling your vendor for technical support.
   They will be better able to help you use their custom features if you
   can tell them your exact parallel port configuration.

    Parallel -- the Parallel Port Information Utility
    -------------------------------------------------

        A handy utility which examines your system's parallel ports and
        reports the Port Type, IO address, IRQ level, BIOS name, and an
        assortment of informative notes and warnings in a compact and easy
        to read display. The output may be redirected to a file for tech
        support purposes. Parallel uses very sophisticated techniques for
        port and IRQ detection and is aware of a broad range of quirky port
        features.

        Parallel is the definitive parallel port Tech Support tool.

        Parallel is Freeware, subject to a restricted license agreement.
        It may be used free of charge for any personal, non-commercial
        purpose. Vendors should contact us regarding commercial licenses.

        A forthcoming commercial version of Parallel will use an active
        loopback connector enabling many new features including detailed
        resolution of port IO behavior and effective throughput testing.

    Parallel Port Networking
    ------------------------

        Now you can network two PCs using your favorite network software
        with just a parallel port cable between the systems.

        Our family of parallel port network drivers (PIPX, PNDIS, PPACKET,
        and others TBA) work with standard network software to turn your
        parallel port into a network adapter.  All types of ports are
        supported with a very few specific exceptions.

        Supports: Netware Lite, Workgroups for Windows, MS Lan Manager,
        various TCP/IP systems, and other network operating systems that
        use the ODI, NDIS, or packet driver interfaces.

        Performance is better than you might expect, ranging from a low
        end of 40 KBps between 4BIT ports all the way up to an effective
        200 KBps between EPP ports using our TURBO cable. This upper range
        is better than many ethernet ISA cards.

        The drivers are available with or without cables, and existing cable
        types typically used with laplink type products are also supported.


    The MultiPort Parallel Port Expansion System
    --------------------------------------------

        The MultiPort 4-port multiplexor turns your parallel port into
        a general purpose expansion system, capable of supporting up to
        four simultaneously operating parallel port peripherals including
        network adapters, portable hard drives, tape backup units, CDROMs,
        floppies, and so forth. For example, you can use the MultiPort Mux
        to attach a network adapter, a hard disk, a CD-ROM, and a printer,
        all operating together through a single parallel port.

        Now your laptop (and desktop) can enjoy a full range of peripherals
        with all the portability, sharability, and convenience of parallel
        port devices.


    Parallel Port Developer's Kit
    -----------------------------

        Pipx was constructed with Parallel Technologies' advanced parallel
        port software, which has been used in over 10 parallel port devices
        including network adapters, parallel port disks, parallel port
        wireless IR adapters, parallel port MIDI interfaces, and so forth.

        This software includes support for all types of ports, IO code
        that is extremely resistant to port idiosyncrasies, and full
        autodetection of all port hardware features. The code is very well
        documented. A selection of sample drivers for parallel port devices
        is also available.

        parallel MIDI adapter, and the MultiPort parallel port expander.


    Development Services
    --------------------

        We specialize in contract development of parallel port peripherals
        and associated software including DOS and Windows device drivers.
        Our broad and deep experience with parallel port devices and our
        commitment to specialization allows us to design, implement, test,
        and support them very efficiently.

        You might be interested in our 30/90 development offer. We propose
        to convert any ISA peripheral into a parallel port device in only
        30 days to prototype, 90 days to production.

        We also offer more limited development support, such as developing
        additional devices drivers for existing peripherals.

        We are quite experienced with EPP ports and are ready to upgrade
        your existing parallel port devices to full EPP performance.


    Consulting and Training
    -----------------------

        In support of in-house development, you will find our consulting
        and training services invaluable in avoiding the pitfalls of
        parallel port development while achieving the highest possible
        product performance and quality.
