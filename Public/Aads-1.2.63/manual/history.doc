		AADS is a freeware library, source code

		but cannot be sold in any way.
		
		
		
Introduction:
-------------	
			
	The concept of Aads began somes years ago. At this moment it was only 
somes basics functions that allows the programmer (myself !) to do more 
easily common GEM action.


	Well, at the end of the year 1994 (Just before going to Army), i began
to think how write a more efficiant library who will be very helpfull. 
At this time, i didn't want just another library to get some new graphics 
objects, but really a new powerfull programming way to remove all low-level 
GEM problems.
