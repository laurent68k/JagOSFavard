				  Buggs report fixed:
				-----------------------
				

	* 6/10/95:	
	----------
	
	Bug fixed in PcXMenu, the main menu was unable to operate with AES previous 
	the 3.3 version, for example with a ST TOS 1.2. and sended an "illegal function" 
	message.
	In fact, a call to istart() function was the reason. Only the AES 3.4 and above
	can execute this call. Now, an AES version test is performed.
	
	* 6/10/95:
	----------
	
	Bug fixed in PcXMenu, the main with AES 3.3 and previous always send another
	message "PcXMenu Warning". This error occured after the user has clicked any
	Menu Option. 
	This is due, because i always compared the Menu address with the address returned
	by the AES message's buffer, BUT the old AES don't return this information...
	
	* 7/10/95:
	----------
	
	Bug fixed about text editable. Now, you can mix any object type into the
	same tree level with text editable, without serious trouble.
	
	This error was due, PcXForm considered that all object's brothers for a
	text editable, was ALWAYS text editable !
	So, PcXForm attempted to set the text cursor for all objects...

	* 24/10/95
	----------
	
	The popups menus couldn't be correctly displaying, when the attach button wasn't
	the direct child of the root object. The popup was drawing at the sum of both 
	x,y position of the root object and the x,y position of the button.
	Well, it is now the sum of all objects beetwen the root object until the button.
	
	* 30/12/95
	----------
	
	A bug was already present into the cursor management about the editable field.(!)
	When a dialog box contained only one editable field into one tree level, the Up 
	and Down arrow don't work and serious trouble in the application happened.
	

	* 01/01/96
	----------
	
	The deskyop's color icon wasn't fully understand by the PcXDesk's code. 
	For example, When a color icon was selected and you clicked somewhere onto the 
	desktop, it wasn't unselected.
	
	*	17/07/97
	-----------

	-	Increase auto top window when the current top window is modal type into PCxWind.

	-	Call the close procedure before the dialog box is really cleared into PCxForm.
